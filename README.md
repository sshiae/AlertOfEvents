- **Coroutines:** Employs Coroutines for writing asynchronous code, enhancing the efficiency of asynchronous tasks.
- **DataStore Preferences:** Utilizes DataStore Preferences for storing application settings, providing a modern approach to data storage.
- **Navigation Component:** Implements the Navigation Component to facilitate navigation within the application, enhancing the overall user experience.
- **Kizitonwose Calendar:** Incorporates Kizitonwose Calendar to implement a feature-rich calendar in the application.
- **Android SpinKit:** Integrates Android SpinKit to implement a loading spinner icon, improving the visual feedback during loading processes.
- **Flow:** Utilizes Flow to efficiently manage asynchronous data streams, enhancing the application's responsiveness and facilitating the handling of data changes.
- **ViewModel** - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
